    "# Build a chat assistant with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing Foundation Models (FMs) from leading AI companies accessible through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications, simplifying development while maintaining privacy and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are a type of Foundation Model that can take natural langauge as input, with the ability to process and understand it, and produce natural language as the output. LLMs can also can perform tasks like classification, summarization, simplification, entity recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are usually trained offline with data that is available until that point of time. As a result, LLMs will not have knowledge of the world after that date. Additionally, LLMs are trained on very general domain corpora, making them less effective for domain-specific tasks. And then, LLMs have the tendency to hallucinate where the model generates text that is incorrect, nonsensical, or not real. Using a [Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/jumpstart-foundation-models-customize-rag.html) mechanism can help mitigate all these issues. A RAG architecture involves retrieving data that closely matches the text in the user's prompt, from an external datasource, and using it to augment the prompt before sending to the LLM. This prompt augmentation will provide the context that the LLM can use to respond to the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the process of building a chat assistant using a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) and using [Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) for vectorizing, storing, and retrieving data through semantic search. [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/) will be used as the vector index.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to simplify the process of constructing the prompts, and interacting with the LLMs and Knowledge Bases (KBs). In the process of working through this notebook, you will learn how to setup the Amazon Bedrock client environment, configure security permissions and use prompt templates in LangChain. Invocations that involve LangChain will be explicitly mentioned."

In the process, we learned how to build a RAG based assistant using Amazon Bedrock. We have also seen how Amazon Bedrock with its LLMs, and Knowledge Bases (KBs) makes it easy for you to build generative AI applications."

    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon S3, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance (or) Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook depending on what you use to run the notebook.\n",

    "**Q: Will Amazon Bedrock capture and store my data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock doesn't use your prompts and continuations to train any AWS models or distribute them to third parties. Your training data isn't used to train the base Amazon Titan models or distributed to third parties. Other usage data, such as usage timestamps, logged account IDs, and other information logged by the service, is also not used to train the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Bedrock uses the fine tuning data you provide only for fine tuning an Amazon Titan model. Amazon Bedrock doesn't use fine tuning data for any other purpose, such as training base foundation models.\n",

    "Each model provider has an escrow account that they upload their models to. The Amazon Bedrock inference account has permissions to call these models, but the escrow accounts themselves don't have outbound permissions to Amazon Bedrock accounts. Additionally, model providers don't have access to Amazon Bedrock logs or access to customer prompts and continuations.\n",

    "**Q: What is the difference between On-demand and Provisioned Throughput in Amazon Bedrock?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the On-Demand mode, you only pay for what you use, with no time-based term commitments. For text generation models, you are charged for every input token processed and every output token generated. For embeddings models, you are charged for every input token processed. A token is comprised of a few characters and refers to the basic unit that a model learns to understand user input and prompt to generate results. For image generation models, you are charged for every image generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Provisioned Throughput mode, you can purchase model units for a specific base or custom model. The Provisioned Throughput mode is primarily designed for large consistent inference workloads that need guaranteed throughput. Custom models can only be accessed using Provisioned Throughput. A model unit provides a certain throughput, which is measured by the maximum number of input or output tokens processed per minute. With this Provisioned Throughput pricing, charged by the hour, you have the flexibility to choose between 1-month or 6-month commitment terms.\n",
